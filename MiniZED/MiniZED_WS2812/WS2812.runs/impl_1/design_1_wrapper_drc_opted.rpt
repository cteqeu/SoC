2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
86 out of 88 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: FIXED_IO_mio[31:0], FIXED_IO_ddr_vrn, FIXED_IO_ddr_vrp, FIXED_IO_ps_clk, FIXED_IO_ps_porb, FIXED_IO_ps_srstb, DDR_dqs_p[1:0], DDR_dqs_n[1:0], DDR_dq[15:0], DDR_dm[1:0], DDR_ba[2:0], DDR_addr[14:0], DDR_cas_n, DDR_ck_n, DDR_ck_p (the first 15 of 21 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
86 out of 88 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: FIXED_IO_mio[31:0], FIXED_IO_ddr_vrn, FIXED_IO_ddr_vrp, FIXED_IO_ps_clk, FIXED_IO_ps_porb, FIXED_IO_ps_srstb, DDR_dqs_p[1:0], DDR_dqs_n[1:0], DDR_dq[15:0], DDR_dm[1:0], DDR_ba[2:0], DDR_addr[14:0], DDR_cas_n, DDR_ck_n, DDR_ck_p (the first 15 of 21 listed).
Related violations: <none>

IOCNT-1#1 Warning
Number of IOs  
The design contains 86 unplaced I/O ports while the target device, xc7z007sclg225-1, has 52 remaining available user I/O pins. This DRC assumes that all ports which do not drive MGT pins should be placed on user I/O pins. To correct this issue:
1. Ensure you are targeting the correct device and package. Select a larger device or different package if necessary.
2. Check the top-level ports of the design to ensure the correct number of ports are specified.
3. Consider design changes to reduce the number of user I/O pins needed.
